      <p>
        Greetings,
        I successfully completed my 12th Commerce studies in 2021-22 with a notable percentile of 92.40 and an overall percentage of 80.14% With A2 Grade.
        Currently in Semester 4, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Application at Gujarat University, having triumphantly completed Semesters 1, 2, and 3.

        I possess strong typing skills with a speed of 80 words per minute and 95% accuracy. My programming expertise extends to object-oriented programming (OOP) in both C++ and Python, and I am actively engaged in projects on GitHub.

        Eager to deepen my knowledge, I am venturing into Java programming. This journey aligns with my commitment to continuous learning and skill enhancement, making me a dynamic contributor to the programming landscape.

        Open to discussions and collaborations that align with our shared professional interests.

        Best regards,
        Rutvik Prajapati
      </p>
